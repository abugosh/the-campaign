- Background
	- Hey everyone, although there is still a lot of details that still need to be put on paper, I wanted to give you some insight into my character. It seemed that I would be playing a cleric based off of others class preference. My family was from a Noble house residing in the land of Dante until invading or chase them and the rest of the halflings from their ancestral Lance. Traveling by ship family found a new purpose as traveling merchants. It is from growing up while assisting them that I learned to be resourceful, battle and conquest are unfamiliar desires, which have been replaced by the desire to meet new friends and influence races towards a peaceful coexistence. As I grew, I found that my faith continued to inspire me and eventually let me do part ways with my families so that I might become the change that I wanted to see in the world. I took a job in the Dukes castle so that I might make a few coins for the coming pilgrimage, but soon realize that it was an opportunity to train the key skill that would make my journey success. Diplomacy becomes my key role in maintaining satisfied guests but I additionally can be found using my cantrips to ensure that the kitchen always has sufficient freshwater. I'm also able to guarantee that all food and drink are free of poisons and that all castle dishware is safe from the mishaps of both the castle, staff and guests alike. I worship a pantheon of Gods for everything comes from the Gods and everything should be celebrated as the gift it is. As the Gods have made us all, we must try to coexist as that is their desire.
	- My uncle the dragon slaying hafling knight was that last to be seen wielding that family heirloom. He was last questing to an island to the north of Derintyurt when my family lost contact with him. That was 30 years ago and no search party has ever returned.
	- His disappearance and the loss of the lance is believed to be a defining factor that allowed the orcs to force my family into retreat from our homeland
	- There is no evidence that the orcs had anything to do with his disappearance

- Notes
	- Thus far I have a homeland for Dwarves, mountainous as you would expect, The Barag Empire. Then there is a sea-dwelling culture of Halflings that occupy many island and coastal regions with a homeland in Derintyurt. They and many others are experiencing territorial expansions from forces from the Orcish lands of Kemirkor. The story begins in the human Kingdom of Khiz, in the County of Shundige. Khiz is a human Kingdom, predominantly agrariand and feudalistic in arrangement. Unassigned are the lands of Zrag and the Churdean Theocracy.

	- The Churdean Theocracy is *probably* an Elf-led but highly mixed society. But that's not locked in yet. Biracial Elves may be from borderlands of Churd and Khiz, again, not locked in yet.
	- The city of Sadgurth, seat of Count Sadgurth, of county Shundige. Center of the breadbasket of the north. Economic center of Khiz.

	- The border used to be closer to the Midland lakes. Khiz took advantage of The Schism and pushed their borders east with new settlements in the highlands.
	- Churd gods
		- It's a polytheism. Think of the Norse pantheon where the Aesir and Vanir were once opposed and fought against each other, but combined into a single pantheon through marriage between the gods themselves. The Elves claim clerical superiority because their prime deity leads the combined pantheon. But there is a delicate balance within the religion, government, and society of Churd which could absolutely break into a second Schism/civil war.
	- The Halflings are also a polytheism, and just like everything else about their society, their religion is sickeningly wholesome and family oriented. Everyone gets alone with everyone and everything is just perfect. Thank the Sovereign!

	- I am hoping that we can employ similar storytelling here. Start with a setting and a character and a plot point that is unconnected from the main plot and the most important characters. So enjoy this character design, but plan to visit them for a short while and then move on to a new one for a time, before moving on again. Perhaps we will visit multiple parties, returning to them occasionally as the story and world dictate. Eventually, we will find the main characters and engage the main plot, just not yet.
	- Ok, has anyone read Jack Vance's The Dying Earth? It's a classic sci-fi anthology from which much of the basis of modern fantasy magic theory originates. Gygax literally cites it in the Advanced DMG. It also influenced MtG and the way that planeswalkers cast spells. Anyway. The story starts with a series of vignettes, interlocking stories that lightly interest and slowly build a world without dragging a main character through too much exposition. By the time you meet the main character, you understand the world in a way you otherwise wouldn't.
	- Now that we all have our sheets filled, let's think more about your character as a person. Consider the following: •What is an ideal that you hold? It could be a religious or social rule that you live by, or it could be a personal motivator. Something that drives you and would not be broken through your actions. •What do you hold most dear? What is that thing that you would sacrifice to protect? Is it a person? An object? The memory of a better time? • What do you fear? No a phobia, and not of the player (I will not engage player phobias to the best of my ability), but of the character? What is your "nope"? Don't share these for now, workshop them for the first session then write them down for the DM.
